        "Generic ABS profile for Tronxy X5SA with Klipper\n\n!! IMPORTANT - ENCLOSURE REQUIRED !!\nABS requires a heated enclosure or draft-free environment to prevent warping.\nIf you don't have an enclosure, consider using ABS+ or ASA instead.\n\nPrint Temperature: 250-255°C (adjust based on brand)\nBed Temperature: 100-105°C (critical for adhesion)\nChamber Temperature: 40-60°C (if available)\nCooling: MINIMAL - 0-30% max to prevent layer separation and warping\n\nRetraction Settings (Firmware Controlled):\n- Distance: 1.0mm (configured in Klipper firmware_retraction)\n- Speed: 40mm/s\n- Z-hop: 0.2mm\n- These values shown here for reference only; actual retraction controlled by Klipper\n\nPressure Advance:\n- Start with 0.045 for direct drive\n- Fine-tune using Klipper calibration\n- Add to filament_start_gcode: SET_PRESSURE_ADVANCE ADVANCE=0.045\n\nSpeed Guidelines:\n- Perimeters: 50-70 mm/s\n- Infill: 80-120 mm/s\n- First layer: 20 mm/s (slow for maximum adhesion)\n- Overhangs: 30-40 mm/s\n\nCooling Strategy:\n- ABS warps easily with too much cooling\n- Keep fan OFF for first 5 layers minimum\n- Max fan speed: 30% (only for overhangs >60° or bridges)\n- For large prints: consider fan completely OFF\n- Small features (<10mm): may need 20-30% cooling to prevent overheating\n\nBed Adhesion:\n- CRITICAL: Use ABS slurry, glue stick, or PEI sheet\n- Clean bed with IPA before printing\n- First layer: 105°C bed, 255°C nozzle for maximum adhesion\n- Use brim or raft for large prints to prevent corner lifting\n\nWarping Prevention:\n- Enclosed printer strongly recommended\n- Draft-free environment essential\n- Maintain consistent ambient temperature\n- Avoid opening enclosure during print\n- Let parts cool slowly in enclosure after print completes\n\nVentilation:\n- ABS emits styrene fumes - VENTILATION REQUIRED\n- Print in well-ventilated area or use air filtration\n- Do not print ABS without proper ventilation\n\nTips:\n- First layer adhesion is everything - if it doesn't stick, stop and adjust\n- Z-offset: ABS first layer should be slightly squished into bed\n- Post-processing: ABS can be smoothed with acetone vapor (in ventilated area)\n- Annealing: Heat parts in oven at 80°C for 2-3 hours for increased strength\n- Corner lifting: increase bed temp, use brim, or reduce part cooling\n"
