# Phase 1 — Board mapping (Tronxy stock → SKR 1.4 Turbo)

## Stock board identification
## MCU identification

Stock controller uses an STM32F407 MCU.
No visible board serigraphy without removing the board.
This confirms standard STM32F4 compatibility (Marlin / Klipper capable).

Firmware issues are attributed to vendor configuration, not hardware failure.
